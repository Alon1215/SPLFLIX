# SPLFLIX
First project in "Systems Programming" course: building a streaming platform, recommendation - algorithms driven.
***The essence of the project: implement an object-oriented system, gain implementation experience in C++, and using "The rule of 5" for memory handling ***

## Strory frame and logic
- SPLFLIX offers users two types of streaming content â€“ movies and tv-serieses. 
- Like most streaming services we allow a creation of multiple users, while each user receives userspecific recommendations according to his watch history. 
- However, we give our users the ability to choose which recommendation algorithm to use, out of a number of algorithms we offer.

## Running the application
1. make
2. bin/splflix config#.json < inp#.txt
3. start "watching" movies
